<h2><mark>COVID UPDATE OF TODAY:</mark></h2>
<p> <sup><b>T</b></sup>he emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus reminds us how uncertain the world has become. Despite vaccination, the third wave of the pandemic indicates that Covid may continue to remain a part of our life. Experts have cautioned that the virus may not be wiped out fully and could continue to prevail and affect people, but over time it may become weaker and the fatality rate may decline. Omicron seems to signal the beginning of that phase. Hence, we have to prepare ourselves to navigate through its perils and learn how to survive.

    In the face of the rapid surge of Omicron, several countries are reinstating strict measures including travel restrictions and quarantine of travellers. Citizens are being alerted to the dangers. Companies are revisiting their coping strategies. For example, a global financial company has made vaccination mandatory for its staff if they want to keep their jobs. Some companies have announced work-from-home policies for an indefinite period of time.</p>
